# Analysis and Visualization of Crime in London City

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and address crime problems in London using the London Crime dataset from Kaggle. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we hope to uncover patterns and trends in criminal activity within the city. This information can be useful for law enforcement, policymakers, and the general public to understand and mitigate crime in London.
